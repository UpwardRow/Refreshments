# Introduction

**Cook, your way**

The Refreshments mobile application is an application which allows the user to create specific dietary needs, and proposes recipes without said ingredients. A lot of applications on the Play Store allow for preferences like vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free, but are not so accomodating for the more rare dietary restrictions.

# The Technologies
Refreshments is a Kotlin based project, which saves users and the data of the users in AWS. Once a database is designed and configured with this data, a web application will also have the same functionality for a wider range of users.
